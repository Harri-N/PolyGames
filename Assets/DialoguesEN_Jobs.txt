Mr Jobs
Talk to Mr. Jobs
Ah, it was not too early. The world was waiting for you. I already congratulate you for having met all the challenges of my colleagues. Thanks to them, you were able to realize that an engineer must acquire skills in all areas.
All the things you have done so far will obviously help you to face the dragon, but also for all the other problems that will come up against you during your life.
Indeed, the challenges of this world are multiple and it is the role of the engineer to put his knowledge to the benefit of society.
Now go, and don't forget: with great knowledge comes great responsibility.
