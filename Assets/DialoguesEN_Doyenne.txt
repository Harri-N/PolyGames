Talk to the Directress
Hello and welcome to the Facult√© Polytechnique of Mons. Here, we train future engineers, those who will shape the world of tomorrow.
Unfortunately, this world is in danger. Indeed, the Doudou dragon threatens to attack the city. So we need you to face this threat and defend the city.
But don't worry, we're not going to throw you straight into the mouth of the wolf, or rather I should say into the mouth of the dragon.
The professors of the faculty will be there to help you in your quest. You will have to meet them and pass their test. This will allow you to acquire the skills and tools necessary to face the dragon.
I just have to wish you good luck in your adventure.
